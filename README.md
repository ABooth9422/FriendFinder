> A Heroku deployed app to find your friend!

### 🏠 [Homepage](https://github.com/ABooth9422/FriendFinder)

## Install

```sh
npm install express path
```

## Usage

```sh
run npm start
```

## Purpose
The purpose of this app is to demonstrate a full-stack application that is hosted by heroku. This is the first full-stack 

application that we have developed in the program. We are handling our routes and sending responses back from a server

that we have created. The app will store every user that is created on our form in an attempt to match the 

closest matches with the closest absolute value in scores. When the user completes the form it will return the closest 

match to the user that just filled out the form.

## Instructions

Welcome to the app that can find your best friend!

If you want to find your best friend click the button on the home page.

When you get to the next screen fill out all the survey questions and it will return the best match for you.

## API CALLS

Everyone who completes the survey will have there information store in our very own api. If you click the hyperlink in the bottom left 

corner you can have access to our API.
